# movingball-repo
This is a small project from our computational thinking topic at the MIT Xpro full stack program. It got me thinking for sure. 

## The Aim

The aim of this project was to improve our understanding of how the computer needs very specific instructions to run programs effectively. Also understanding how variables and functions work.

## How to Use

To use this code, just copy and paste the code in a code editor and save it to an html file. then open the link in your browser. Feel free to play around with colors by adding new colors, and by adjusting the speed via the velocity variable. 

## Support
